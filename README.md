Introducing Atlas, the game that will help you unwind and relax as you explore a procedurally generated world filled with lush forests. With its isometric viewpoint and pixel art style, Atlas is a retro-visually game that is sure to captivate you.

With its procedurally generated world, Atlas offers endless opportunities for exploration and discovery. No two games will be the same, so you can keep coming back to Atlas again and again for a new and exciting experience.

So if you're looking for a game that will help you relax and unwind, look no further than Atlas. With its beautiful forests, charming pixel art style, and endless possibilities for exploration, it's the perfect game for anyone looking to escape into a peaceful and immersive world.

## Why Pygame?
Because it is a beautifully optimized and much more complete library, and quite low-level compared to Raylib and Arcade Pyglet. Moreover, it is in the computer science speciality program in high school. And moreover the next versions of Pygame will use SDL2 which greatly improves the speed of calculation and display by using also the GPU (11x faster)

## What is Perlin/Simplex Noise ? üå´

[Perlin Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise) is a procedural texture calculator developed by [Ken Perlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Perlin) in 1985. He studied at Harvard University, New York University and now he is a computer scientist, engineer and university professor.

The function has a pseudo-random appearance, and yet its generation is not really random, it is only the seed that is. 

This property allows this texture to be easily controllable. Multiple zoomed-in copies of Perlin Noise can be inserted into mathematical expressions to create a wide variety of procedural textures.

Perlin Noise is well known for its use in the generation of Minecraft worlds as well as in many other video games. So it's its ease to do many things that attracted us.

#### Why Simplex Noise and not Perlin Noise ?

Complexity :
- Perlin_noise : $O(n^2)$
- Simplex_noise : $O(n)$

Lower computational complexity, cost and fewer multiplications makes the a very fast computing speed

## To Do üìã

- üêõ Remove bugs/errors :
‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ°‚ñ°‚ñ°‚ñ°‚ñ° 50%
<i>For the moment there are no bugs discovered but we leave it for the next versions</i>
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Optimization :
‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ° 95%
- üìê Support for the size of the open file

## Installation

#### Update pip
<i>Don't forget to use the latest version of pip, it's not essential for this code but it's always good to update</i>
```
pip install --upgrade pip
```

#### Tkinter
<i>This library is extremely important, all the display is based on</i>
```
pip install tk
```

#### Yml
<i>This library is important because it is used to load the settings of _config.yml</i>
```
pip install pyyaml
```
