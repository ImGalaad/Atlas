𝗠𝗮𝗽 𝗚𝗲𝗻𝗲𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗼𝗿 is a very simple program that procedurally generates a map with a random seed.

We use the Perlin Noise to make this natural overview.

## Perlin Noise 🌫

Perlin Noise is a procedural texture calculator developed by [Ken Perlin](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Perlin) in 1985.
He studied at Harvard University, New York University and now he is a computer scientist, engineer and university professor.

The function has a pseudo-random appearance, and yet its generation is not really random, it is only the seed that is. 

This property allows this texture to be easily controllable. Multiple zoomed-in copies of Perlin Noise can be inserted into mathematical expressions to create a wide variety of procedural textures.

Perlin Noise is well known for its use in the generation of Minecraft worlds as well as in many other video games. So it's its ease to do many things that attracted us.
